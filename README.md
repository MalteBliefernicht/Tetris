# Tetris

One of my earliest 'real' projects. The first time using pygame and working with a proper GUI.
This is definitely not a finished product. After several weeks I felt it was time to move on and learn something else.
But I was pretty proud at the time that it worked at all.
The code is pretty messy, but cleaning it up now would cost a lot of time I would rather invest in something more useful.
